      "I developed a Django-based system that uses <span>face recognition artificial intelligence</span> to help lecturers of Fakulti Sains Komputer & Teknologi Maklumat (FSKTM) to record the attendance of their students. The system automatically scans the faces of students as they enter the classroom and records their attendance. The system also allows lecturers to view the attendance records of their students at anytime.",
